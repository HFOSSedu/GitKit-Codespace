    <title>GitHub Personal Access Token</title>

    <p>
      When starting your development environment for the first time (in <xref ref="topic-development-environment"/>) you will be asked to enter a <term>Personal Access Token (PAT)</term> from GitHub.
    </p>

    <p>
      A PAT is like a password but has some security benefits.
      In particular, you can have multiple different PATs.
      Each one can have different limits on what can be done with it and each one can be revoked individually without affecting the others.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          Follow GitHub's instructions for creating a classic personal access token.
          Be sure to select Tokens (classic) - you will need to do this twice - and to choose "repo" for the "scopes and permissions": <url href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic" visual="docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic">Creating a Personal Access Token (classic)</url>.

        <p>
          Be sure to copy and paste your PAT somewhere safe â€“ maybe e-mail it to yourself.
          You will not be able to retrieve it again after you leave the page.

    <title>Setting the GitHub Codespaces Timeout</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        The GitKit development environment runs in GitHub Codespaces.
        GitHub provides you with approximately 60 hours per month of free Codespaces use.
        By default the GitKit development environment will timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity.
        It is recommended that you reduce this timeout to 15 minutes to avoid accidentally consuming your allotted free usage.
      </p>
