  <title>FOSS Communities</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      During class time you will have learned about the principles that guide FOSS Communities and the roles that are performed by FOSS community members.
      The exercises in this section ask about those principles and roles.

    <title>FOSS Community Principles</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Some of the key principles that guide FOSS communities are <term>shared values</term>, <term>collaboration</term>, <term>transparency</term>, <term>inclusivity</term>, <term>meritocracy</term> and <term>release early and often</term>.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you would like you can review a discussion of these principles in the speaker notes in <url href="https://github.com/HFOSSedu/GitKit-Codespace/raw/refs/heads/main/materials/slides/Ch2-CommunitiesAndCollaboration.pptx">the slides for this chapter</url> or in <url href="https://opensource.com/open-source-way" visual="opensource.com/open-source-way">The Open Source Way.</url>

                                    <introduction>
                                      <p>
                                        One way of understanding FOSS communites is to consider the different roles that people take on in these communities. Some of these roles include <term>Users</term>, <term>Requestors</term>, <term>Contributors</term>, <term>Maintainers</term> and <term>Leaders</term>. These roles are prototypical and not every one of them roles will exist exactly in every FOSS community. Some communities will have slightly different roles, or multiple roles may be combined, etc. In addition, a given individual might simultaneously, or at different times take on multiple roles. So even though they are not exact or universal, understanding these prototypical roles can be helpful in understanding how work happens in FOSS communities.
